# üì± Convert HTML/CSS/JS to Android APK using GitHub Actions

This project allows you to build an Android APK from a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend without installing Android Studio or the Android SDK locally. All APK builds are done **entirely in GitHub Actions**.

## üöÄ How to Use This

### 1. **Create a GitHub Repository**

Go to [github.com](https://github.com), create a new repository (public or private), and name it anything you like (e.g., `my-pwa-to-apk`).

---

### 2. **Prepare Your Files**

In the root of the repo, include the following:

* `index.html` ‚Äî Your main HTML file
* `styles.css`, `app.js` ‚Äî Your CSS/JavaScript files
* Optional:

  * `assets/` ‚Äî Images or media
  * `app.png` ‚Äî App icon (square, at least 512x512; can be in root or assets/)
  * `package.json` ‚Äî For Node projects with build scripts like React, Vue, etc.

---

### 3. **Add the GitHub Actions Workflow**

Create the following folder structure in your project:

```
.github/workflows/build-apk.yml
```

Paste this into `build-apk.yml` (already included if you cloned this repo):

> See [build-apk.yml](.github/workflows/build-apk.yml) for full script.

---

### 4. **Push Your Code**

Commit and push everything to the `main` branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with build workflow"
git push origin main
```

Or use GitHub‚Äôs **"Upload files"** ‚Üí **"Commit changes"** feature.

---

### 5. **Run the Workflow**

* Go to the **Actions** tab in your repo.
* Select **Build Android APK**.
* You‚Äôll see the latest run triggered (automatically or manually).
* Wait a few minutes for the build to complete.

---

### 6. **Download the APK**

* Once the workflow finishes, scroll to the bottom of the run.
* Under **Artifacts**, download `pong-app-release.apk`.
* You can now sideload it on any Android device!

---

## üì≤ Sideload APK on Android

1. Send the APK to your Android device.
2. Enable **Install from Unknown Sources**.
3. Open the APK file to install it.
4. Launch your app!

---

## üß∞ Advanced Options

### üîê Code Signing (Optional)

If you want to publish your APK to the Google Play Store:

* You must sign it with a private key.
* Uncomment the signing section in `build-apk.yml`.
* Inject your keystore as a GitHub secret (e.g., `KEYSTORE_BASE64`).

### üóâÔ∏è Use with Frameworks

If you use React, Vue, Svelte, etc., ensure your build output goes into `www/`. Example in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build --outDir www"
}
```
